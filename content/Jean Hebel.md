## Obituary

We mourn the loss of Jean Marie Killelea who entered Eternal Life the evening of  
November 20, 2021. Born October 12, 1927 to Andrew and Helen Hebel in Peru, Illinois.  
Growing up in a large family, the eighth of nine children, Jean attended St. Joseph’s parish grade school and received her diploma from LaSalle-Peru Twp. High School, LaSalle, Illinois. Over the years she became an accomplished pianist and was a soloist in the parish choir.  
She was athletically inclined and worked as a lifeguard, enjoyed league bowling, golf and played tennis well into her 70’s. She studied at LaSalle-Peru-Oglesby Jr. College and earned a degree from Rosary College, River Forest, Illinois. She was employed at the University of Notre Dame Library and the Chicago Public Library. A blind date with a medical student at Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine led to her marriage to Donald Joseph Killelea August 5, 1950, a Jubilee year, at St. Joseph’s Church, Peru Illinois. They recently celebrated their 71 year Anniversary. She and her husband opened their hearts and home and adopted three babies. A devoted and faithful Catholic she was known for her cheerful disposition and beautiful smile. Her prayers were and are still powerful before Our Lord. She took part in Perpetual Adoration, attended daily Mass, made a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land and recited the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  
She was preceded in death by her parents, all her siblings and her son, John Francis Killelea.  
Jean Marie is survived by her husband, daughters Susan Marie and Kathleen Marie and her son Timothy Andrew, their spouses, six grandchildren and three great grandchildren.  
A funeral Mass will be celebrated Saturday November 27, at St. Jude Thaddeus Church in Pharr, Texas. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Pharr Oratory of St. Philip Neri.
